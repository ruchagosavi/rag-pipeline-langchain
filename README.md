📌 Overview

RiskRadar is a production-style Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to analyze business risk factors for banking and financial use cases.

Instead of relying on generic LLM answers, RiskRadar:

Retrieves factual business data

Performs semantic search

Uses an LLM to reason strictly over retrieved evidence

Produces explainable, grounded insights

This mirrors how real-world banking AI systems are designed.

🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional risk assessment systems:

Rely heavily on credit score and rigid rules

Miss qualitative risk indicators (notes, negative news, patterns)

Lack explainability

Are difficult to scale and audit

RiskRadar solves this by combining:

Vector search (FAISS)

Embeddings (Sentence Transformers)

Controlled LLM reasoning (ChatQA style)

🧠 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

RAG enhances LLMs by grounding responses in retrieved knowledge.

This approach:

Prevents hallucination

Ensures traceability

Is suitable for regulated domains like banking

This modular structure follows production engineering practices, not notebook-style experimentation.

🔑 Key Concepts Used
1️⃣ Sentence Embeddings

Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2

Converts text into semantic vectors

Enables meaning-based search (not keyword-based)

2️⃣ FAISS Vector Search

Stores embeddings efficiently

Performs fast similarity search

Easily replaceable with cloud vector databases later

3️⃣ Chunking Strategy

Each business record is converted into a context-rich text chunk:

Business Name
Business Type
Revenue
Profit Margin
Loan History
Negative News
Notes


This preserves business context for accurate reasoning.

4️⃣ Retriever

The retriever:

Embeds the user question

Finds top-K relevant business records

Supplies only relevant data to the LLM

5️⃣ ChatQA Prompting

The LLM is explicitly constrained:

“Use only the provided context. Do not use external knowledge.”

This ensures:

No hallucinations

Explainable outputs

Compliance-friendly behavior

6️⃣ LLM (Local Inference)

Uses Ollama + LLaMA models

Runs locally (no API costs, no data leakage)

Temperature kept low for factual answers

🧪 Example Question
Which risk factors mentioned in the reports could indirectly
increase loan default probability even if the customer has a good credit score?

Why this works:

Requires reasoning

Cannot be answered by keyword search

Demonstrates RAG superiority

🧩 Why This Is Production-Ready

✔ Modular codebase
✔ Separation of concerns
✔ Grounded LLM reasoning
✔ Explainable outputs
✔ Easy to extend (API, frontend, cloud)
✔ Aligned with banking compliance needs

🚀 Future Enhancements

FastAPI backend

React frontend dashboard

Persistent vector store

Multi-turn memory

Risk scoring

Cloud deployment

Authentication & access control
