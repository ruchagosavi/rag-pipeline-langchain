# rag-pipeline-langchain
A complete from-scratch implementation of a modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using LangChain. This project demonstrates end-to-end AI workflow automation — including document ingestion, text chunking, embeddings generation, vector store indexing, retrieval orchestration, and LLM-powered responses.
